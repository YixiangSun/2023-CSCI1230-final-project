The ball goes ~~~~~~〇

To run it, download the files, delete build and .txt.user files, and open cMakeList.txt in QTCreator. Change the working directory to the local project file. Uploade a scenefile from the folder 'senefiles' by pressing the button shown on the interface. You will need QTCreator 6.2–6.4.
